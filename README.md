# YouTube downloader using DelphiVCL, PyInstaller and PyTube

A simple python script using DelphiVCL and PyTube to download videos from YouTube.

Running on Python, using DelphiVCL, I have created a YouTube downloader with a GUI that runs on Windows. The YouTube downloading capability is powered by PyTube and the exe has been published using PyInstaller.
